  powerpc: check_and_cede_processor() never cedes

  interrupts\") caused check_and_cede_processor to stop working.
->irq_happened will never be zero right after a hard_irq_disable
  so the compiler removes the call to cede_processor completely.

  The bug was introduced back in the lazy interrupt handling rework
  of 3.4 but was hidden until recently because hard_irq_disable did
  nothing.

  This issue will eventually appear in 3.4 stable since the
  hard_irq_disable fix is marked stable, so mark this one for stable
  too.

  powerpc/ftrace: Do not trace restore_interrupts()

  As I was adding code that affects all archs, I started testing function
  tracer against PPC64 and found that it currently locks up with 3.4
  kernel. I figured it was due to tracing a function that shouldn't be, so
  I went through the following process to bisect to find the culprit:

   cat /debug/tracing/available_filter_functions > t
   num=`wc -l t`
   sed -ne \"1,${num}p\" t > t1
   let num=num+1
   sed -ne \"${num},$p\" t > t2
   cat t1 > /debug/tracing/set_ftrace_filter
   echo function /debug/tracing/current_tracer
   <failed? bisect t1, if not bisect t2>

  It finally came down to this function: restore_interrupts()

  I'm not sure why this locks up the system. It just seems to prevent
  scheduling from occurring. Interrupts seem to still work, as I can ping
  the box. But all user processes freeze.

  When restore_interrupts() is not traced, function tracing works fine.

  powerpc: Fix Section mismatch warnings in prom_init.c

  This patches tries to fix a couple of Section mismatch warnings like
  following one:

  WARNING: arch/powerpc/kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x2923c): Section mismatch
  in reference from the function .prom_query_opal() to the
  function .init.text:.call_prom()
  The function .prom_query_opal() references
  the function __init .call_prom().
  This is often because .prom_query_opal lacks a __init
  annotation or the annotation of .call_prom is wrong.

  ppc64: fix missing to check all bits of _TIF_USER_WORK_MASK in preempt

  In entry_64.S version of ret_from_except_lite, you'll notice that
  in the !preempt case, after we've checked MSR_PR we test for any
  TIF flag in _TIF_USER_WORK_MASK to decide whether to go to do_work
  or not. However, in the preempt case, we do a convoluted trick to
  test SIGPENDING only if PR was set and always test NEED_RESCHED ...
  but we forget to test any other bit of _TIF_USER_WORK_MASK !!! So
  that means that with preempt, we completely fail to test for things
  like single step, syscall tracing, etc...

  This should be fixed as the following path:

   - Test PR. If not set, go to resume_kernel, else continue.

   - If go resume_kernel, to do that original do_work.

   - If else, then always test for _TIF_USER_WORK_MASK to decide to do
  that original user_work, else restore directly.
